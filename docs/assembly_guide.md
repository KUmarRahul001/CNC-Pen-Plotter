# Assembly Guide

## Introduction
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for assembling your CNC Pen Plotter.

## Materials Needed
- Frame components (aluminum, wood, or plastic)
- Linear rails and bearings
- Stepper motors
- Microcontroller (Arduino)
- Stepper motor drivers
- Power supply
- Limit switches
- Wiring
- Pen holder mechanism
- Screws, bolts, and other fasteners

## Steps
### 1. Frame Assembly
- Assemble the frame using the provided design in `hardware/frame_design/frame_design.pdf`.
- Ensure the frame is stable and all connections are secure.

### 2. Motion System
- Attach the linear rails and bearings to the frame.
- Install the stepper motors and connect them to the motion system using belts and pulleys.
- Make sure the motion system moves smoothly along the rails.

### 3. Electronics Integration
- Connect the stepper motors to the motor drivers.
- Wire the limit switches and connect
